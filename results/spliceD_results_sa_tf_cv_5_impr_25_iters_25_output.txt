Simulated Annealing Feature Selection

5256 samples
2325 predictors

Maximum search iterations: 25 
Restart after 25 iterations without improvement (0 restarts on average)

Internal performance values: RMSE, Rsquared
Subset selection driven to minimize internal RMSE 

External performance values: RMSE, Rsquared, MAE
Best iteration chose by minimizing external RMSE 
External resampling method: Cross-Validated (5 fold, repeated 5 times) 

During resampling:
  * the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 2325):
    TGC3 (52%), A11 (48%), AAT13 (48%), ACG13 (48%), ACN11 (48%)
  * on average, 513 variables were selected (min = 466, max = 552)

In the final search using the entire training set:
   * 550 features selected at iteration 25 including:
     TT1, CCC1, GCC1, ATC1, CAC1 ... 
   * external performance at this iteration is

       RMSE    Rsquared         MAE 
     0.2547      0.6065      0.1303
