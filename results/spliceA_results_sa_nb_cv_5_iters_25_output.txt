Simulated Annealing Feature Selection

5788 samples
3780 predictors
2 classes: '0', '1' 

Maximum search iterations: 25 
Restart after 10 iterations without improvement (2 restarts on average)

Internal performance values: Accuracy, Kappa
Subset selection driven to maximize internal Accuracy 

External performance values: Accuracy, Kappa
Best iteration chose by maximizing external Accuracy 
External resampling method: Cross-Validated (5 fold) 

During resampling:
  * the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 3780):
    CC86 (100%), NC70 (100%), SG4 (100%), A60 (80%), AN35 (80%)
  * on average, 763 variables were selected (min = 757, max = 773)

In the final search using the entire training set:
   * 757 features selected at iteration 1 including:
     SG1, TT1, ST1, AA1, AC1 ... 
   * external performance at this iteration is

   Accuracy       Kappa
