Simulated Annealing Feature Selection

5256 samples
2325 predictors
2 classes: '0', '1' 

Maximum search iterations: 25 
Restart after 10 iterations without improvement (1.8 restarts on average)

Internal performance values: Accuracy, Kappa
Subset selection driven to maximize internal Accuracy 

External performance values: Accuracy, Kappa
Best iteration chose by maximizing external Accuracy 
External resampling method: Cross-Validated (5 fold) 

During resampling:
  * the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 2325):
    AC3 (80%), ACC12 (80%), AG15 (80%), ANG8 (80%), ATG6 (80%)
  * on average, 473 variables were selected (min = 466, max = 486)

In the final search using the entire training set:
   * 466 features selected at iteration 1 including:
     A1, G1, N1, GC1, NC1 ... 
   * external performance at this iteration is

   Accuracy       Kappa 
     0.7877      0.0000
