Simulated Annealing Feature Selection

5256 samples
2325 predictors

Maximum search iterations: 25 
Restart after 10 iterations without improvement (0.6 restarts on average)

Internal performance values: RMSE, Rsquared
Subset selection driven to minimize internal RMSE 

External performance values: RMSE, Rsquared, MAE
Best iteration chose by minimizing external RMSE 
External resampling method: Cross-Validated (5 fold, repeated 5 times) 

During resampling:
  * the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 2325):
    TAG12 (52%), ACG8 (48%), CAN14 (48%), GNT3 (48%), NT1 (48%)
  * on average, 514.8 variables were selected (min = 474, max = 559)

In the final search using the entire training set:
   * 504 features selected at iteration 24 including:
     GT1, CA1, TA1, AA1, TG1 ... 
   * external performance at this iteration is

       RMSE    Rsquared         MAE
