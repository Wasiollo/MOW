Simulated Annealing Feature Selection

5788 samples
3780 predictors

Maximum search iterations: 25 
Restart after 10 iterations without improvement (0.4 restarts on average)

Internal performance values: RMSE, Rsquared, MAE
Subset selection driven to minimize internal RMSE 

External performance values: RMSE, Rsquared, MAE
Best iteration chose by minimizing external RMSE 
External resampling method: Cross-Validated (5 fold) 

During resampling:
  * the top 5 selected variables (out of a possible 3780):
    TN54 (100%), AA18 (80%), AA51 (80%), AA78 (80%), AG42 (80%)
  * on average, 844.6 variables were selected (min = 795, max = 877)

In the final search using the entire training set:
   * 864 features selected at iteration 23 including:
     A1, GG1, TG1, NG1, SG1 ... 
   * external performance at this iteration is

       RMSE    Rsquared         MAE 
     0.3130      0.3800      0.2492
